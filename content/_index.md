### Welcome to my Homebase

'Homebase', is a landing page for my blog, various projects, and an opportunity to provide my socials in a centralized location.

Please feel free to connect and contact me on any of my listed socials.

### Experience

Please check out my experience here!

### Purpose

The website is an abridged version of the 'Cloud Resume Challenge' that I hope to grow into a personal playground for DevOps practice. I hope to include some meta blog posts.
